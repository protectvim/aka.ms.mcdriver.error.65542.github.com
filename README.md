Some Minecraft players end up encountering the [GLFW Error 65542](https://computersolve.com/aka-ms-mcdriver-error-65542/) every time they attempt to launch the game. This problem is mostly reported to occur on Windows 10 with the Java-based version of Minecraft.

The majority of users that have been struggling with this error code were able to fix the GLFW Error 65542 by copying the missing opengl32.dll file manually into the JRE (Java directory). If that doesn’t work or you want to avoid doing any manual modifications to the JAVA directory, you can also reinstall every GPU driver in order to ensure that the opengl32.dll file gets reinstalled.

However, if you’re encountering this issue with the Java version of Minecraft, this problem can also be facilitated by a conflict with a DisplayLink driver. In this case, you can fix the issue by uninstalling the conflicting driver and re-launching the game.

There are three methods for resolve this issue

Method 1: Adding the OpenGL.DLL Manually
Method 2: Uninstalling DisplayLink (if applicable)
Method 3: Reinstalling Video Card Drivers
